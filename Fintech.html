      <h3 class="text-center"><em>"Millenial's Bank Online with 72% Engaging with mobile channels"</em></h3>
      <br>
      <h3>Outline</h3>
      <p>Mobile banking is changing. Fin-tech companies offer a different simpler alternative to more traditional form of banking for millennial’s. 92% of millennial’s are online and 72% engage in mobile channels, being the most frequently online generation .Also, only 66 percent of this generation visited brick’s and mortar stores within the last 6 months, compared 80 percent of baby boomers. As a result, Fin-tech offers the latest technology in banking which can change how we interact with our money.</p>
      <p>I wanted to focus down on what Millenial’s would like to achieve. Using IOS for the increased emotional attachment Millenial’s have to the platform. And to focus on the most common devices (standard size iPhone 6, 7, 8).Consequently gave me the goal to create a clean, simple, yet functional application experience.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>Research was focused in two main aspects. Finding out already what made Fin-tech so popular in the first place, and what features Millenial’s would want to focus on. From my own network interviews were carried out with potential users. As a result,  a list was decided on with the most important aspects:Easy transferring
        Ability to split bills, Simple and functional, Instantaneous banking, Money spending habits, Set up limits.</p>
      <p>Housing habits changed this generation. Having the largest population size at 79.8 million in 2016, only 28 million headed households of their own. This shift in the way we live shows more are renting, and sharing property. Having the ability to split bills and know which bills are going where needed to be a priority.</p>
      <h3>Prototyping</h3>

      <div id="modal01" class="w3-modal" onclick="this.style.display='none'">
        <span class="w3-button w3-hover-red w3-xlarge w3-display-topright">&times;</span>

        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>Once the flow had been created the high fidelity designs were next. Including features for splitting bills and activating auto saving to round up purchases. The final designs shows a complete user journey. Further showcasing concepts for easy splitting.</p>
