      <h3>About The Company</h3>
      <p>NN4M is a software house that focuses on leading eCommerce application and has just recently been acquired by the Wunderman group. I worked here starting as a Junior UI/UX designer and be promoted to a mid-level.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>My role</h3>
      <p>Within the company, I worked with a small team of designers that were dedicated to varying development teams depending on the client's workload at any given time. </p>
      <p>In the year and a half I worked there I spent the majority of the time focussing my efforts on handling the Selfridges and Brown Thomas Clients alongside working with Elkjop and Listening into Action on smaller projects</p>
      <p>A lot of my focus within the Junior portion was directly dealing with clients and ensuring the quality within both designs has high that would lead to Pixel Perfect designs. A few months on I took more responsibility with looking into clients user testing and how they produced it to creating concepts for new clients and partaking in presentations with hi-fidelity concepts to clients that shared user research they had created with us.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>As a result of working projects, we shipped numerous and successful new features for Selfridges and embedded a successful new process that works for Brown Thomas.</p>
