      <br>
      <p>New requirements for the product required a major shift in the previous generations onboarding experience which was based around desktop applications. This was shifted to the mobile applications to ensure a smoother experience in handling the watches data.</p>
      <p>Our Initial starting point incorporated feedback from out internal support team alongside feedback from user surveys giving out to beta test users from our demographics to ensure we had a mix of qualitative and quantitative research to work with on a tight budget.</p>

      <p>Whilst creating mid fidelity designs we used remote user testing to test with non golfers as proxy users for potential new users. This insight helped us to reach a wider demographic internationally, and receive insights to new users that may not have used a similar product in the past.</p>
      <p>This research suggested we break down every step of what is required to use the device without focussing on the length of the setup process. As long as it was simple to understand and have further help when required we could ensure users even in our older target market (55) could onboard without needing to contact support.</p>
      <p>Although some additions had to be cut due to deadline constraints, overall the onboarding had been successful in ensuring new users were able to set up their new watch correctly and quickly.</p>
